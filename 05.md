The `t` tag
------------

`draft` `mandatory`

This spec redefines the usage of the `t` tag in both `REQ` and `EVENT` messages for both clients and relays.

The `t` tag is a lowercase text value that defines a hashtag assigned to the event. It **must** be lowercase and contain no spaces, special characters, or emojis. This applies even if the original hashtag contains uppercase letters.

Example:
```
{
  ...
  "content": "Say hello to #Nocturn!",
  "tags": [
    ["t", "nocturn"]
  ]
  ...
}
```
