NOC-03
======

Relay-to-Relay Communication
----------------------------

`draft` `mandatory` `wip`

This `NOC-` specification defines how a Nocturn (or Nostr) relay communicates with other relays.

A relay may establish a WebSocket connection to other relays, just as a client would.

To enable relay-to-relay communication, a new attribute, `eids`, is added to the `filter` field of `REQ` in [NIP-01](https://github.com/Yonle/nips/blob/8e6f2c06c3ec88a6c478a783825ff1b07e1972fa/01.md). This allows a relay to specify event IDs it should not receive, preventing redundant event propagation (e.g., if the relay already has the event).

Example:

```
["REQ", <subscription-id>, {
  ...
  "eids": [...]
}]
```
