Relay to Relay Communications
-----------------------------

`draft` `mandatory` `wip`

This `NOC-` specification defines how an Nocturn (or nostr) relay communicate to other relays.

A relay may establish an websocket connection to other relays like client normally did.

For a working relay to relay communications, One attribute is added to `REQ`'s `filter` field on [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/8e6f2c06c3ec88a6c478a783825ff1b07e1972fa/01.md), `eids`, Which give exception to relay on what event IDs that they shouldn't send for various reasons (the current relay already has the event, etc).

```
["REQ", <subscription-id>, {
  ...
  "eids": [...]
}]
```
