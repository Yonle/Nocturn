Tracker System
--------------

`draft` `mandatory`

This specification defines the tracker protocol, which allows clients to query available relays dynamically instead of relying on hardcoded lists. Clients may disable this feature if they prefer manual relay configuration.

## Communications between clients and tracker

Tracker expose a websocket endpoint to which clients can connect.

### Client to Tracker

Clients can send two types of messages, formatted as JSON arrays:

- `["DIR"]`, used to getting a list of relays.
- `["SUBMIT", <relay-url>]`, used to submit relay to an tracker with an URL.

When a client submit an relay to tracker, The tracker should check that the requested relay is active. A tracker may reject SUBMIT requests if:

- The relay is already listed.
- The relay is blacklisted.
- The tracker operates on a whitelist-only approach.

### Tracker to Client

Relays can send 2 types of messages, which must also be JSON arrays, according to the following patterns:

- `["DIR", <arrays of relay URLs>]`, used to send list of relay URLs to clients, Which then the client connects to the listed relays.
- `["NOTICE", <message>]`, used to send message to client.
- `["OK", <relay-URL>]`, used to confirms that a submitted relay has been successfully listed."
