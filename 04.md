Search Capability
-----------------

`draft` `mandatory`

This spec redefines [NIP-50](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/50.md) on how relay may process search requests.

As mentioned in [NOC-01](01.md):
> Only events containing a `#t` (hashtag) tag are publicly discoverable. Events without tags (`#t`) are not publicly discoverable. They can only be retrieved using `authors` or direct `ids` queries.

Search results may only include:
- Events containing `#t` (hashtag) tags.
- Events without `#t` tags, but only if the user follows the author.
