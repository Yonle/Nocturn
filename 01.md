`draft` `mandatory`

This spec redefines the [NIP-01](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/8e6f2c06c3ec88a6c478a783825ff1b07e1972fa/01.md) on communication between clients and relays.

## Client to Relay

As per NIP-01, Clients can send 3 types of messages, which must be JSON arrays, according to the following patterns:

**Events Querying**
- `["REQ", <subscription-id>, <filters>]`
- `["CLOSE", <subscription-id>]`

**Event Submitting**
- `["EVENT", <event>]`

An event is considered public if the `tags` attribute has atleast one `t` tag (or hashtag).

Upon receiving a `REQ` message, Relay **should** ensure that every filters has atleast one value in the following attributes:

|Attribute|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`ids`|Event IDs|
|`authors`|Author IDs|
|`#e`|List of events (a.k.a. replies to an events)|
|`#p`|List of public keys (a.k.a. mentions)|
|`#t`|Tag, or hashtag.|

If one of the request filter has none of the preceding, Then the request **should be rejected**.
