`draft` `mandatory`

This spec redefines the [NIP-01](https://github.com/Yonle/nips/blob/8e6f2c06c3ec88a6c478a783825ff1b07e1972fa/01.md) on communication between clients and relays.

## Client to Relay

As per NIP-01, Clients can send 3 types of messages, which must be JSON arrays, according to the following patterns:

**Events Querying**
- `["REQ", <subscription-id>, <filter1>, <filter2>, ...]`
- `["CLOSE", <subscription-id>]`

**Event Submitting**
- `["EVENT", <event>]`

Only events containing a `#t` (hashtag) tag are publicly discoverable. Events without tags (`#t`) are not publicly discoverable. They can only be retrieved using `authors` or direct `ids` queries.

Upon receiving a `REQ` message, Relay **SHOULD** ensure that each filter has at least one value in the following attributes:

|Attribute|Description|
|---------|-----------|
|`ids`|Event IDs|
|`authors`|Author IDs|
|`#e`|List of events (e.g. replies to an events)|
|`#p`|List of public keys (e.g. mentions)|
|`#t`|Tag, or hashtag.|

A relay **MUST** reject any REQ that does not include at least one of the required attributes.

**Relay Response Example:**

Valid `REQ`:
```
["REQ", "sub-id-123", {"authors": ["npub1..."], "#t": ["nostr"]}]`
```

Invalid `REQ` (Missing all required filters):
```
["REQ", "sub-id-123", {}]
```

- Valid `REQ` → Process normally, return matching events.
- Invalid `REQ` → Relay responds with `["NOTICE", "invalid: Missing required filters."]` and ignores the request.
